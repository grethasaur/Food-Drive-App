# Food-Drive-App

This contains the map sample for the Edmonton Food Drive Project. 

Please zoom into McConachie neighbourhood, this contains the route samples.

Markers are the neighborhood imported from City of Edmonton-Neighbourhood dataset, and the routes provided is my own sample. 

I disabled the route layer from the client but I integrated some of route information into my own sample such as route 49 etc.
