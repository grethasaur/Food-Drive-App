# Food-Drive-App

This contains the map sample for the Edmonton Food Drive Project. 

Please zoom into McConachie neighbourhood, this contains the route samples.

Markers are the neighborhood imported from City of Edmonton-Neighbourhood dataset, and the routes provided is my own sample. 

I disabled the route layer from the client (you can enable that again on the left top side) and I integrated some of route information into my own sample such as route 49 etc.

I'm still currently working on it so it is less crowded and figuring out how to make it more interactive and hopefully figure out how to allows  user input
